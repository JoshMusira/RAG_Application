Lindsey Graham said Sunday the 2024 presidential race would be “dramatically different” if Vice President Kamala Harris replaces President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, which he believes is a “most likely” outcome.
    



        “If Biden steps down, Harris is going to have to pick somebody to help her. If she does become the nominee, this is a dramatically different race than it is right now today. I hope people are thinking about that on our side,” Graham said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”
    


            Graham said former President Donald Trump should consider Harris’ candidacy when picking his running mate and used the opportunity to push for his fellow South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott."

MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you support a public hearing with the intelligence chiefs to lay out the facts as we know them? I know Director Wray said we are at the highest possible level of threat right now. REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes, and, Margaret, look, I think it's - it's really important for people to keep this in context. That may true, and it's probably true because the world is a more complicated place than it was ten years ago, in particular with the war in Israel and Gaza. We see every radical Islamic group from the Houthis to all the Iranian-backed proxies interested in doing things that they might not have wanted to do ten years ago.
